# Part D

Since `num_descendants` and `num_vals` are computed before running the find medain algorithm and included in the tree structure, it will only take $O(1)$ time to get them. 

In the best case, in which the median is the first value of the root, it will only take $O(1)$ time to get the result.

Since there are at most 4 children of each node, it will take $O(1)$ time to travel through them

In the worst case, the median is in the leaf node of the longest branch of the tree, and that branch is located in the right most child. Since travelling through children in a level will only take $O(1)$ time, the algorithm will take $\theta(h)$ time to travel to the bottom of the tree, where $h$ represents the height of the tree.

In terms of space complexity, neglecting the memory usage for recursion, the algorithm will take $O(1)$ space since it doesnâ€™t require any external storage besides several variables that store temporary data.
